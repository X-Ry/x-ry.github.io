Hi! I'm Ryan Newkirk. I am currently working at [Hive](https://thehive.ai/) as a Backend Software Engineer. I recently graduated from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) and obtained a Bachelors and Masters degree with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Data Science and Engineering. Over Summer 2022 and Summer 2023 I worked at at [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en).
