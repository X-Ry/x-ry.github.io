### A Computer Vision License Plate Privacy Project

At Northwestern University, I worked with four other students and delved into the realm of computer vision and privacy protection with the project CLOAK: Computer Learning for Obfuscating Automobile Knowledge. As the prevalence of online image sharing continues to surge, our focus was on safeguarding individuals' privacy by addressing the potential risks posed by publicly available vehicle license plate information. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks and object detection models like YOLOv5, we aimed to automatically detect license plates in images and apply appropriate levels of blur to conceal sensitive information while preserving image utility. This endeavor not only emphasized the importance of balancing privacy and utility but also showcased the potential of machine learning in addressing real-world privacy concerns in the digital age.
